- name: Control What You Can&colon; Intrinsically Motivated Task-Planning Agent

  desc: We present a novel intrinsically motivated agent that learns how to control the environment in the fastest possible manner by optimizing learning progress. It learns what can be controlled, how to allocate time and attention, and the relations between objects using surprise based motivation. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in a synthetic as well as a robotic manipulation environment yielding considerably improved performance and smaller sample complexity. In a nutshell, our work combines several task-level planning agent structures (backtracking search on task graph, probabilistic road-maps, allocation of search efforts) with intrinsic motivation to achieve learning from scratch.

- name: Attentional bias through oscillatory coherence between excitatory activity and inhibitory minima
  img: 
  desc: An implementation of attentional bias is presented for a network model that couples excitatory and inhibitory oscillatory units in a manner that is inspired by the mechanisms that generate cortical gamma oscillations. Attentional biases are implemented as oscillatory coherences between excitatory units that encode the spatial location or features of the target and the pool of inhibitory units. This form of attentional bias is motivated by neurophysiological findings that relate selective attention to spike field coherence. Including also pattern recognition mechanisms, we demonstrate how this implementation of attentional bias leads to selection of an attentional target while suppressing distracters for cases of spatial and feature-based attention. With respect to neurophysiological observations, we argue that the recently found positive correlation between high firing rates and strong gamma locking with attention (Vinck, Womelsdorf, Buffalo, Desimone, & Fries, 2013) may point to an essential mechanism of the brainâ€™s attentional selection and suppression processes.
